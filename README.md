**Framework for implementing CERE-CTDE**: A novel multi-agent reinforcement learning architecture integrating **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)** with **Random Network Distillation (RND)** to address Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off in cooperative environments. Validated on StarCraft II (SMAC) and PressurePlate environments.

## Key Innovations
- **Combine design of Exploration-Oriented and Exploitation-Driven components in the dynamic tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**
- **CERE-CTDE improves the learning ability of Actor-Critic methods and Value-Decomposition methods**
- **Innovative measures for optimizing MAS learning efficiency**
