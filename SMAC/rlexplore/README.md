# Reinforcement Learning Exploration Baselines (RLeXplore)

RLeXplore is a set of implementations of intrinsic reward driven-exploration approaches in reinforcement learning using PyTorch, which can be deployed in arbitrary algorithms in a plug-and-play manner. In particular, RLeXplore is
designed to be well compatible with [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), providing more stable exploration benchmarks. 

# Notice
**This repo has been merged with a new project: [https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/rllte](https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/rllte), in which more reasonable implementations are provided!**

Invoke the intrinsic reward module by:
``` python
from rlexplore.rnd import RND
```
